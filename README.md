## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Architecture

This app is built using the following modern Android development technologies:

- **Repository Pattern**: Provides a clean API for data access by abstracting data sources.

### **Libraries & Frameworks**
- **Room Database**: Manages local data storage efficiently with SQLite.
- **Navigation Component**: Handles in-app navigation with ease, supporting arguments between destinations.
- **LiveData & ViewModel**: For reactive and lifecycle-aware data handling.
